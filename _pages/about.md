I'm a PhD student in the [Programming Languages Research Group](https://bristolpl.github.io/) at University of Bristol, supervised by [Meng Wang](https://mengwangoxf.github.io/) and [Roly Perera](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/roly-perera). My current research investigates the formalisation and implementation of algebraic effects in probabilistic programming. My other interests include functional programming (in particular, Haskell), type-level programming, type theory, and design of embedded domain-specific languages (eDSLs).

**Research**

Based around the ideals of row-polymorphism, I employ algebraic effect handlers and extensible data to allow models in probabilistic programming languages to be simultaneously composable and general-purpose (i.e. suitable for all forms of simulation and inference). This is implemented as an eDSL called [Wasabaye](https://github.com/min-nguyen/wasabaye) in Haskell.

Previously, I investigated the embedding of neural networks as recursion schemes, showing that the notion of forward and back propagation during neural network training can be captured as the composition of catamorphisms (folds) and anamorphisms (unfolds). This is implemented as an eDSL called [Catana](https://github.com/min-nguyen/catana) in Haskell.
