**Projects**

<span style="color:#AA9E9D">Jan, 2022</span> <span style="color:#3C6BE4"> Linked visualisations via Galois dependencies </span><br/>
<span style="color:#85868B"><font size="2"> We present new language-based data provenance techniques for linking visualisations and other structured
outputs to data in a fine-grained way. This builds on bidirectional program slicing techiques based on Galois connections. </font> </span><br/>

<sup>POPL '22</sup><br/><br/>
<span style="color:#AA9E9D">Aug, 2021</span> <span style="color:#3C6BE4"> Composable, Modular Probabilistic Models </span><br/>
<span style="color:#85868B"><font size="2"> We present an effect-oriented embedded DSL in Haskell for modularly defining probabilistic models as first class citizens which can be reused for both simulation and inference. We then demonstrate how simulation and inference can be expressed naturally as composable program transformations using algebraic effect handlers.</font> </span><br/>

<sup>ICFP '21, Student Research Competition</sup><br/><br/>
<span style="color:#AA9E9D">Jun, 2019</span> <span style="color:#3C6BE4"> Folding Over Neural Networks</span><br/>
<span style="color:#85868B"><font size="2"> We demonstrate that it is possible to encode the training of neural networks as a recursion scheme system -- specifically as the composition of catamorphism and/or anamorphisms. This is shown across a range of complex network types: fully-connected networks, convolutional networks, and deep LSTM networks.</font> </span><br/>

**Awards**

<span style="color:#AA9E9D">2021</span> <span style="color:#AE3C33">_ACM Student Research Competition, 1st Place  (ICFP '21)_</span><br/>
   <font size="2">This corresponds to my project entitled "Composable, Modular Probabilistic Models", in which I use algebraic effects to embed  probabilistic programming language in Haskell, allowing for composable models which are suitable for all forms of simulation and inference. </font><br/>
<span style="color:#AA9E9D">2019</span>  <span style="color:#AE3C33">_Best Final Year Machine Learning Paper, University of Bristol_</span><br/>
   <font size="2">This corresponds to my masters dissertation entitled "Folding over Neural Networks" which demonstrates that it is possible to encode the training of neural networks as a recursion scheme system -- specifically as the composition of catamorphism and/or anamorphisms. This was shown across a range of complex network types:  fully-connected networks, convolutional networks, and deep LSTM networks. </font><br/>
<span style="color:#AA9E9D">2018</span>  <span style="color:#AE3C33">_Best Group Project, University of Bristol_</span><br/>
   <font size="2">This comprised the development of a VR Horror Game, in which I was responsible for programming the player and enemy mechanics, and the game interaction/event system. This used C#, Unity, Oculus Rift and Touch, and a Bluetooth Heart Rate Monitor.</font><br/>
